## Micrograd: A Mini Autograd Engine with MLP and Visualization
Micrograd is a lightweight, educational automatic differentiation library built from scratch in Python. 
It supports defining simple neural networks like multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and performing backpropagation to train them. 
It also provides a function to visualize the computational graph, giving insights into the gradient flow during training.
